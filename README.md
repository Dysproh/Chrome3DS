# Chrome3DS
Chrome3DS is a homebrew program designed as an alternative to the default 3DS browser.
### But why?!?!?
I just felt like making the 3DS better and noticed that there are no homebrew web browsers yet.
### Anything we need to know?
It is REALLY bugged at the moment, and the bugs we know of are
* The strange rendering
* The refusal to build
* HBKB not being implemented due to strange behavior
### So how do I build it?
Do the following commands:
    git clone --recursive github.com/Dysproh/Chrome3DS.git
    cd Chrome3DS
    make
Then just copy the 3DSX file onto your sd card and enjoy how useless it is atm!
